## 2026-06-28 — Bootstrap: adopt trading-system documentation + merge workflow

- **DECISION** Establish a CLAUDE.md-driven "document-and-merge" workflow modeled on the
  trading-system repo, per the owner's request to replicate that repo's automatic
  documentation + direct-to-`main` commit habit. The mechanism is **pure instruction**
  (no git hook / CI gate) — it lives in `CLAUDE.md` and is honoured by whoever works the repo.
- **CHANGE** Added `CLAUDE.md` (root): non-negotiable rules (read `experiences/` first;
  quarantine-not-delete; behaviour-preserving; verify `pytest tests/` + `npm run build` before
  merge; append to this log), owner standing directives (document after every task; commit &
  merge straight to `main` once green, no PR unless asked — with a managed-session note that
  pins work to the assigned feature branch), system map, run/migration instructions, and a
  "where things live" + conventions section.
- **CHANGE** Created `docs/overhaul/` (this log + `README.md` + `REMOVAL_CANDIDATES.md`) and
  `docs/decisions/README.md`; extended `.gitignore` to keep ephemeral artifacts
  (`decision_*.md`, `inbox/` contents) out of git while tracking the folder READMEs.
- **FINDING** `experiences/README.md` already defines the kebab-case + YAML-frontmatter format
  (identical in spirit to trading-system), and a "Knowledge Center" (`/knowledge-center`) page
  is documented to read this folder — so no new experiences format was needed, only the audit
  log + decision-report conventions.
- **NOTE** This work is committed to the managed-session feature branch
  `claude/lifemanager-setup-nx9izb` (the environment forbids pushing elsewhere); the
  merge-to-`main` directive in CLAUDE.md governs unconstrained local work.

## 2026-06-28 — Phase 1: AI Settings upgraded to the ALLIN1 catalog design

- **DECISION** Port ALLIN1's "complete AI settings" surface (provider catalog → models with
  capabilities → per-task model routing → live test + sync) into Lifemanager, ADDED ALONGSIDE
  the legacy per-user `AIProvider`/`AIModelConfig` system (CLAUDE.md rule 2: legacy provider
  CRUD still lives in `Settings.jsx` + `/ai/providers`/`/ai/configs`; nothing removed). The new
  `/ai-settings` page is transformed to the new form.
- **CHANGE** New models `app/models/ai_catalog.py` — `AICatalogProvider` (key PK, encrypted
  key + env fallback), `AICatalogModel` (capabilities/source/priority), `AITaskRoute`. Distinct
  `ai_catalog_*` table names avoid colliding with the legacy `ai_providers`/`ai_model_configs`.
- **CHANGE** New service layer under `app/services/ai/`: `catalog.py` (PROVIDER_CATALOG for
  Anthropic/Claude-sub/OpenAI/Gemini/DeepSeek/OpenRouter/Perplexity/xAI + CAPABILITIES +
  TASK_TYPES + idempotent `seed_ai_catalog`), `manager.py` (`ai_manager.resolve(task)` →
  `ResolvedModel`, env-var key fallback), `inference_gateway.py` (native `complete` +
  `complete_multimodal` for Anthropic/Gemini/OpenAI families — reused by Phase 2 import),
  `catalog_tester.py` (`test_model` ping + `sync_provider_models`).
- **CHANGE** New router `app/routes/ai_catalog.py` (prefix `/ai`, dual-mounted at `/ai` and
  `/api/ai` in `main.py`): `GET /overview`, `PUT /providers/{key}`, `POST /providers/{key}/sync-models`,
  `GET|POST /models`, `PUT|DELETE /models/{id}`, `POST /models/{id}/test`, `GET /routes`,
  `PUT /routes/{task}`. All additive — verified no method+path collision with the legacy router.
  Keys stored encrypted via `crypt_service`, never returned (masked hint + `has_api_key`).
- **CHANGE** Rewrote `frontend/src/pages/AISettings.jsx` to the new form (provider cards: enable,
  key save/clear, base_url, sync, model list with capability chips + per-model test/delete +
  add-custom; task-routing selects). Updated `AISettings.test.jsx` to the new contract.
- **CHANGE** Alembic migration `0031_ai_catalog.py` (head 0030 → 0031) creates the 3 tables;
  models registered in `app/models/__init__.py`; idempotent startup `seed_ai_catalog` added to
  `main.py` startup_event (Render free-tier path). New tests `tests/test_ai_catalog.py` (7).
- **FINDING / PITFALL** `from __future__ import annotations` in a FastAPI route/schema module
  makes `Body(...)` model annotations forward-ref strings → pydantic v2 raises *"TypeAdapter …
  is not fully defined"* at request time (a green build/import does NOT catch it; only an actual
  POST/PUT does). Fix: drop the future import from request-body schema + route modules. Recorded
  in `experiences/pluggable-ai-provider-catalog-and-router.md`.
- **VERIFY** `python -m pytest tests/ -q` → 933 passed, **15 failed** — all 15 are PRE-EXISTING
  on the clean baseline (auth-enforcement env tests, ruff lint debt, google-oauth, inventory,
  env-parity; verified via a HEAD worktree). The 2 migration tests I initially broke (new tables
  w/o migration) are fixed. `cd frontend && npm run build` → clean. New files ruff-clean.

## 2026-06-28 — Phase 2: Import feature (spreadsheet bulk + AI document) ported from ALLIN1

- **DECISION** Build a unified **Import** page + `/api/imports` surface modeled on ALLIN1's
  import (Excel/CSV bulk with dry-run + async AI document extraction). Adapted to Lifemanager's
  user-scoped, dependency-free targets: **tasks / people / incomes / assets** (Transaction needs
  an account FK → deferred). Existing JSON list-sync (`/api/lists/sync-from-file`) and finance
  message-ingest are KEPT (CLAUDE.md rule 2); this is the new unified entry point, not a replacement.
- **CHANGE** `app/services/import_service.py` — registry-driven engine: `parse_table` (CSV/XLSX
  [lazy openpyxl]/JSON), `IMPORT_TARGETS` (columns + row→model builder + dedup key per target),
  `import_rows` core (validate → idempotent dedup by natural key → dry-run or commit →
  ImportResult), `bulk_import`, and the AI path (`_extract_rows_with_ai` via the AI catalog
  gateway `complete`/`complete_multimodal`, `parse_model_json`, async `spawn_analyze_job`).
- **CHANGE** `app/models/import_job.py` (`import_jobs` table) for the async AI path + history;
  `app/routes/imports.py` (`/api/imports/{targets,{target}/template,{target},ai-models,analyze,
  jobs,jobs/{id}}`). Registered in `main.py` + `models/__init__.py`; alembic `0032_import_jobs`.
- **CHANGE** `requirements.txt` += `openpyxl==3.1.5` (lazy-imported; CSV/JSON still work without it).
- **CHANGE** Frontend `frontend/src/pages/Import.jsx` (mode tabs spreadsheet/AI, target picker,
  CSV template link, dry-run preview + commit, AI model picker + analyze-with-poll, import
  history). Wired `/import` route in `App.jsx` + a Sidebar entry ("ایمپورت داده").
- **CHANGE** New tests `tests/test_imports.py` (10): parse/dry-run/commit/idempotent/row-errors,
  JSON people import, AI-extraction persistence (monkeypatched model), and endpoint coverage.
- **NOTE / FOLLOW-UP** The async AI job processes in a background task using `SessionLocal`
  (production-correct: one DB). In the in-memory test harness the request db ≠ SessionLocal, so
  end-to-end completion isn't asserted via HTTP — the extraction+persist core is unit-tested
  directly instead. `docs/ARCHITECTURE_INVENTORY.json` should be regenerated to list the new
  Import page + endpoints (the inventory test was already failing pre-existing; not regressed).
- **VERIFY** `python -m pytest tests/ -q` → **944 passed, 15 failed** (same 15 pre-existing; 0 new).
  `cd frontend && npm run build` → clean. New backend files ruff-clean.

## 2026-06-28 — Settings IA: consolidate AI + Notifications into a tabbed Settings page

- **DECISION** Owner feedback (on the live site): the `/settings` page's older AI options feel
  redundant now, and Notifications should live under Settings too. Consolidate Settings into a
  **tabbed** shell rather than scattering AI config across pages.
- **CHANGE** `frontend/src/pages/Settings.jsx` rewritten as a tabbed shell with three tabs:
  **هوش مصنوعی** (renders the new `<AISettings/>` catalog), **اعلان‌ها** (renders
  `<Notifications/>`), **پیشرفته (قدیمی)** (the previous Settings body — legacy provider/model/
  context + the editable analysis prompt). Initial tab derived from the URL
  (`/settings/ai-models`→ai, `/settings/notifications`→notifications, `?tab=`), read via
  `window.location` so the component renders router-free in unit tests.
- **CHANGE** `AISettings.jsx` and `Notifications.jsx` gained an `embedded` prop that drops the
  full-page `min-h-screen` chrome + duplicate `<h1>` when hosted inside a Settings tab; both
  still work standalone at `/ai-settings` and `/notifications` (capability preserved).
- **CHANGE** `App.jsx`: `/settings/notifications` now renders `<Settings/>` (opens the
  Notifications tab) instead of `<Notifications/>` directly; `/settings/ai-models` already → Settings.
  Sidebar links left unchanged (standalone pages still reachable).
- **DECISION (quarantine, not delete — rule 2)** The legacy AI provider/model/context config is
  NOT removed: it still feeds the existing analysis pipeline (`provider_service` reads the
  per-user `AIProvider`) and owns the global analysis prompt. It's moved out of the default view
  into the "پیشرفته (قدیمی)" tab, with an in-UI note pointing to the new AI tab. Logged in
  `REMOVAL_CANDIDATES.md`.
- **CHANGE** `Settings.test.jsx` updated to the tabbed structure (switches to the Advanced tab
  for the legacy assertions; adds tab-switching coverage).
- **VERIFY** `cd frontend && npm run build` → clean. `npx vitest run` → **88 passed, 11 failed**;
  the 11 are PRE-EXISTING (jsdom `window.location`/navigation limitations — confirmed identical
  with this round's edits stashed: 87 passed/11 failed). Settings + AISettings suites: 12/12 green.
  Verified visually in a real browser (all three tabs render embedded correctly). Backend untouched.
- **CHANGE (follow-up)** Decluttered the sidebar: removed the standalone «تنظیمات هوش مصنوعی»
  and «اعلان‌ها» links now that both are tabs under «تنظیمات». Standalone routes (`/ai-settings`,
  `/notifications`) + the header notification bell remain (capability preserved). `Sidebar.test`
  updated. `npm run build` clean; Sidebar suite 3/3.
- **CHANGE (workflow)** Per the owner's explicit instruction, this work is merged **straight to
  `main`** (the trading-system pattern) rather than left on the feature branch — the
  managed-session caveat is overridden by explicit owner permission for this repo. CLAUDE.md
  updated so merge-to-`main` is the default going forward.

## 2026-06-28 — Settings: retire the legacy "advanced" tab; relocate the analysis prompt

- **FINDING** Grepped consumers of the legacy Settings "advanced" tab: the `AIModelConfig`
  context knobs (`context_type`/`dynamic_response`/`token_limit`) have **no live readers** in
  `app/`; the global **analysis prompt** (`/api/ai/global-prompt`) **is** used (`model_service`
  composes it into analysis; `task_feedback` reads it).
- **CHANGE** Removed the legacy provider/model/context **UI** and the «پیشرفته (قدیمی)» tab from
  `Settings.jsx` (owner approval). Settings is now two tabs: «هوش مصنوعی» + «اعلان‌ها».
- **CHANGE** Relocated the **analysis prompt** (textarea + save/cancel, `/api/ai/global-prompt`)
  into `AISettings.jsx` (the «هوش مصنوعی» tab) — kept because it's actively used. Loaded via its
  own effect so a post-mutation refresh never clobbers an in-progress edit.
- **PRESERVED (rule 2)** The legacy endpoints `/api/ai/providers`, `/api/ai/configs` and the
  `AIProvider`/`AIModelConfig` models + their rows are untouched — only the UI was dropped.
  Updated `REMOVAL_CANDIDATES.md` with the retire path (migrate the analysis pipeline to the
  catalog first).
- **CHANGE** `Settings.test.jsx` trimmed to the two-tab shell + prompt-relocation check;
  `AISettings.test.jsx` gained an analysis-prompt load/save test.
- **VERIFY** `npm run build` clean; Settings + AISettings suites **7/7** green. Backend untouched.

## 2026-06-28 — IA: group related pages into tabbed hubs (owner-approved plan)

- **DECISION** Owner asked to tidy the ~16-item sidebar **without deleting any content**, being
  careful with pages holding important data/lists. Chose the "three hubs" plan (confirmed via a
  preview prompt): consolidate related pages into tabbed hubs using the **safe embed pattern** —
  each page component is **reused unchanged** via a new `embedded` prop; only the outer full-page
  chrome (`min-h-screen` wrapper + duplicate `<h1>`) is dropped when hosted in a tab. **No page
  data/logic touched.**
- **CHANGE** Added `embedded` prop (cosmetic root-wrapper only) to 9 pages: BudgetPage, AssetsPage,
  SmartAssistant, Recommendations, PersonalityProfilePage, CareerPlanningPage, DriveFiles,
  MergeManagement, Import (the 8 were patched by an asserted single-match script).
- **CHANGE** New hub shells: `FinanceHub` (برنامه و بودجه + دارایی‌ها), `AssistantHub` (پیشنهادات
  + تاریخچه + پروفایل شخصیت + ترسیم آینده), `DataHub` (ایمپورت + فایل‌های من + ادغام تسک‌ها). Each
  picks its initial tab from the URL so the **existing routes still resolve** (e.g. `/assets`
  opens FinanceHub's assets tab; `/merge` opens DataHub's merge tab) — nothing removed.
- **CHANGE** `App.jsx` re-points those routes to the hubs (removed the now-unused direct imports);
  `Sidebar.jsx` collapsed to: داشبورد · کارها · پروژه‌ها · لیست‌ها · افراد · پروژه‌های خارجی ·
  مالی · دستیار هوشمند · داده · تنظیمات (16 → 10 items).
- **CHANGE** New `hubs.test.jsx` (3) verifies each hub's tabs + default panel + switching (child
  pages mocked to isolate tab logic).
- **VERIFY** `npm run build` clean (126 modules). hubs + Sidebar + Settings suites **9/9** green.
  Full vitest: 11 failed = the SAME pre-existing files (Dashboard/Footer/Header/Layout/Projects/
  Tasks/api — none touched here); 0 new. **Visually confirmed all 3 hubs in a real browser** (with
  a real login token) — embedded pages render full content, data/lists intact, no layout mess.

## 2026-06-28 — TO-DO review: re-examine every residual, advance what's in-repo

- **DECISION** Owner asked to go through every `TO-DO/` task one-by-one, verify the "done" ones
  are still correct against the (much-changed) current code, advance anything now doable in-repo,
  skip none, and after each **only update the index file** (no archive/delete). Reviewed all 8
  residuals (the index tracked only 6 — added the 2 missing: 78c0e8e0, 882723eb).
- **FINDING** All 8 are genuinely external/blocked (operator prod-data, third-party creds, device
  hardware, or design-deferred). In-repo halves re-verified intact: 9a5a3b4d (migration CLI imports
  + `--help` OK; get_required_user_id/REQUIRE_AUTH present), 217909d2 (scan/sync/external-drives +
  celery reconcile), 7367c6f0 (drive upload/cold-tiering/sheets seam), 78c0e8e0 (per-user scoping +
  secret refusal), 2165524b (physiological/voice endpoints), d2146781 (oversight + GenericHttpAdapter).
- **CHANGE (4ae4b3ca — in-repo advance)** The `process_finance_updates` Celery task was a no-op even
  with `FINANCE_IMAP_URL` set — the IMAP *pull* was never implemented. Built
  `app/services/finance_imap_service.py` (stdlib `imaplib`: `parse_imap_url`, `fetch_unseen_email_bodies`
  — connect, pull UNSEEN, mark Seen) and wired it into the task → each body flows through
  `apply_bank_message`. Added the missing `FINANCE_IMAP_URL`/`FINANCE_SMS_WEBHOOK`/`FINANCE_INGEST_USER_ID`
  to `.env.example` (the residual file had claimed they were there). Tests: `tests/test_finance_imap_4ae4b3ca.py` (5).
- **CHANGE (882723eb — in-repo advance)** Added `tests/locustfile.py` (read-heavy `HttpUser`) +
  `requirements-dev.txt` (locust, dev/CI-only — not collected by pytest, not in the runtime image).
  Residual reduced to "run it against staging".
- **DECISION (no dead code)** Left 78c0e8e0 (JWT denylist — would be dead under login-bypass) and
  d2146781 (speculative vendor adapters — untestable without creds) as documented residuals.
- **CHANGE** Rewrote `TO-DO/_index.json` → version 2, all 8 items, accurate per-task `status`
  (blocked-operator | blocked-external | blocked-hardware | blocked-design) + an `agent_review`
  note per item + `last_reviewed_at`. Individual task `.md` files left untouched per owner's
  "only update the index" instruction.
- **VERIFY** `python -m pytest tests/ -q` → **949 passed, 15 failed** (same 15 pre-existing; 0 new).
  New backend files ruff-clean. locustfile not pytest-collected.

## 2026-06-28 — Merge Projects + External Projects; fix frequent auto-logout

- **CHANGE (IA)** Owner: `/projects` and `/external-projects` should be one for now. Added
  `ProjectsHub` (tabs «پروژه‌های من» / «پروژه‌های خارجی») using the safe embed pattern — `Projects`
  and `ExternalProjects` reused unchanged via a new `embedded` prop. `App.jsx` points both routes
  at the hub; removed the standalone «پروژه‌های خارجی» sidebar link. hubs.test extended (ProjectsHub).
- **FIX (auth — frequent logout, root cause #1)** `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES` defaulted to **30
  minutes** → the token expired mid-session and the next request 401'd → logout. Raised the default
  to **43200 (30 days)**, env-overridable (`app/config.py`). The expiry test reads the setting
  dynamically, so it still passes.
- **FIX (auth — frequent logout, root cause #2)** `AuthContext.fetchMe` cleared the token on **any**
  non-200 `/auth/me` response — so a Render free-tier cold-start 5xx, a 404 (when the Google
  `/auth/me` route isn't mounted), or a 429 logged the user out on the next mount. Now it drops the
  token **only on a genuine 401**; transient/other responses keep the session (the token still
  authorizes `/api` calls). The axios 401-redirect interceptor is unchanged (genuine-401 only).
- **VERIFY** `cd frontend && npm run build` clean; AuthContext (12) + Sidebar (3) + hubs (5) green;
  backend `test_jwt_auth_pipeline.py` 14/14. Full vitest: 11 pre-existing failures, 0 new.

## 2026-06-28 — People Profiles (task 3cc09436): surface score/relationship in the list

- **REVIEW** Re-examined the People-Profiles feature (owner resent the old spec, "wasn't satisfied").
  Found it already thoroughly implemented and meeting every AC: `PersonProfile` model (all fields),
  service (deeds good/bad + important flag, note tone-analysis, score, relationship, reminders,
  suggestions, analyze blend), endpoints (`/profile`, `/analyze`, `/note`, `/deed`, `/reminders`,
  `/suggestions`), the rich `PersonProfilePage`, and the `PeopleProfiles` list with a per-person
  profile link. Did NOT rebuild any of it.
- **FINDING (the real gap)** The افراد LIST showed only names: it called `/api/persons` (no profile
  data), so the AI **score + relationship were never visible at a glance** — contrary to the voice
  intent ("یه امتیازی بهش می‌ده"). The `relationship_type` badge silently never rendered (undefined).
- **CHANGE (additive — no contract disruption)** Added `GET /api/people-profiles/summary` (Person
  ⟕ PersonProfile, user-scoped) returning each person + `ai_score`/`relationship_type`/`last_analyzed_at`.
  The existing `/api/people-profiles` + `/api/persons` list contracts are unchanged. `PeopleProfiles.jsx`
  now consumes `/summary` and shows the score (subtitle) + a Persian relationship badge
  (نزدیک/معمولی/دور/پرتنش/خنثی) per person, keeping the profile link.
- **Dependencies synced:** upstream — PersonProfile/Person models, score_from_deeds buckets,
  get_optional_user_id; downstream — `PeopleProfiles.jsx`, `person_profile.test.jsx`, `NewPages.test.jsx`
  (mock key `/persons`→`/people-profiles/summary`), `tests/test_people_profiles.py` (+summary test);
  cross-tier backend→frontend — new GET consumed by the list page; backend→db — NONE (LEFT JOIN on
  existing tables, no migration); infra/env — none. No Manual-required part → no TO-DO file.
- **VERIFY** backend `tests/test_people_profiles.py` 6/6 + full suite **950 passed / 15 pre-existing
  failed (0 new)**; `npm run build` clean; person_profile + NewPages **6/6**; ruff clean.

## 2026-06-28 — Complete Google Drive integration (connect/sync from the UI)

- **DECISION** Owner asked for a *complete* Google Drive connection for lifemanager —
  folder creation, a DB-backed connection, real data upload/list, and frontend management —
  modelled on ALLIN1's Drive pattern. The repo was already **injection-ready**:
  `google_drive_service` / `sheets_service` accepted an injected `client` + `refresh_token` and
  raised `NotImplementedError` without one; OAuth only did ID-token sign-in (no refresh-token
  capture). So the work was to slot a real adapter into the existing seam, add the
  connection store + OAuth offline flow, and build the UI — all behaviour-preserving.
- **CHANGE (foundation — connection store)** `app/services/drive_settings_service.py`: a
  key/value store over the EXISTING `GlobalSetting` table (lifemanager's equivalent of ALLIN1's
  `system_settings`) — so **no new table / no migration**. Stores the `refresh_token` **encrypted
  at rest** (`crypt_service.encrypt_data`), the connected account email, and a cached root-folder
  id. `store_connection` / `resolve_refresh_token` (DB → env fallback `GOOGLE_DRIVE_REFRESH_TOKEN`
  / `GOOGLE_SHEETS_REFRESH_TOKEN`) / `is_connected` / `disconnect` / `get_status`.
- **CHANGE (core — real client adapter)** `app/services/google_api_client.py`: `GoogleDriveClient`
  (folder find-or-create, upload, list, download) + `GoogleSheetsClient` (find-or-create the
  `LifeManagerIndex` sheet + append) implementing the EXACT async interface the seams expect,
  wrapping the sync google-api-python-client in `asyncio.to_thread`. `refresh_access_token`
  (grant_type=refresh_token), `build_clients` (→ `(None, None)` when disconnected / libs missing),
  `ensure_app_folders` (creates `LifeManagerData` + audio/images/documents/migrated_data, caches
  root id), `make_drive_mover` (cold-tiering uploader). All google imports lazy → stripped image
  still boots.
- **CHANGE (OAuth connect/callback/disconnect)** `app/routes/auth_google.py`:
  `GET /auth/google/drive/connect` redirects to consent with `access_type=offline` + `prompt=consent`
  + `drive.file`/`spreadsheets` scope + a CSRF `state` nonce (httponly cookie); the **shared**
  `/auth/google/callback` now branches on a `drive:`-prefixed state to capture + store the
  refresh_token and eagerly create the folder tree. Sign-in path unchanged (state empty → legacy
  flow). Connect is operator-gated (admin, or sole operator in single-tenant bypass).
- **CHANGE (data connection + management routes)** `app/routes/drive.py` (always mounted):
  `GET /api/drive/status`, `POST /api/drive/disconnect|test|sync` (operator-gated), and
  `POST /api/drive/upload-file` (real multipart upload → pushes bytes to Drive when connected via
  the `google_drive_service.upload_file` seam, else stores local). `app/tasks.py::tier_cold_data`
  now builds the live client + mover + sheets ledger so the scheduled cold-tiering actually
  migrates to Drive when connected.
- **CHANGE (frontend)** New `frontend/src/pages/DriveSettings.jsx` (status grid + Connect /
  Disconnect / Test / Sync, RTL); added as a «گوگل درایو» tab in `Settings.jsx`. `DriveFiles.jsx`
  gained a real "بارگذاری فایل" upload control (multipart → `/api/drive/upload-file`).
- **Dependencies synced (4 directions):** upstream — `GlobalSetting`, `crypt_service`,
  `google_drive_service`/`sheets_service` seams, `exchange_code_for_token`/`verify_google_token`,
  google-api libs (already pinned in requirements). downstream — `DriveSettings.jsx`, `Settings.jsx`
  tab, `DriveFiles.jsx` upload, `tier_cold_data`. db — NONE (reused GlobalSetting; no new table/column,
  no migration). env — documented `GOOGLE_DRIVE_REFRESH_TOKEN` in `.env.example` (+ Drive setup note).
- **FIX (bonus, pre-existing)** `test_env_example_parity` was red because the `_GOOGLE_ISSUERS`
  constant tripped the `GOOGLE_*` env-var scan; allow-listed it (it is a code constant, not config)
  and named the new token-URI constant without a `GOOGLE_` prefix. Now green.
- **VERIFY** backend full suite **961 passed / 14 pre-existing failed (0 new; env-parity now green,
  −1 from baseline)**; new `tests/test_drive_connection.py` 10/10; `npm run build` clean; frontend
  `DriveSettings.test.jsx` 2/2 + `drive_files.test.jsx` 2/2 green, full vitest 11 pre-existing failed
  (0 new); ruff clean on all new/changed files.

## 2026-06-28 — Bidirectional Telegram bot (send + receive + self-heal), modelled on PROJECT-MANAGEMENT

- **DECISION** Owner asked to port PROJECT-MANAGEMENT's *complete two-way* Telegram bot into
  lifemanager and **sync it** with what already existed. The repo already had **one-way** outbound
  only: `notification_service.send_telegram(*, body, chat_id=None)` (a fire-and-forget `sendMessage`
  used by the `verify_failed`/`budget_alert` fan-out). The reference bot's `notification_service.py`
  is 8.3k lines of oversight-specific machinery; we extracted only the **reusable bidirectional core**
  and re-implemented it natively for lifemanager's domain (tasks/notifications), using `httpx`
  (lifemanager convention) not `aiohttp`. Behaviour-preserving: the old send path is unchanged.
- **CHANGE (core service)** New `app/services/telegram_service.py` — `TelegramBot` (async `httpx`
  client): `send` (Markdown + no-parse-mode retry + 429 `retry_after` absorb), class-level per-chat
  flood throttle (≥1.1s/chat + global pause), `send_with_reply_keyboard`, `answer_callback`,
  `set_webhook`/`delete_webhook`/`get_webhook_info`. Inbound `handle_update` dispatches
  `callback_query` then `message.text`, maps persistent-keyboard captions → commands
  (`TEXT_ALIASES`), and **security-gates on `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`**. Commands: `/start` `/help`
  (persistent keyboard), `/menu` (inline), `/ping`, `/diag` (chat id + webhook info), `/status`
  (notification counts + open-task count), `/tasks` `/today` (open tasks with «✅ انجام شد» inline
  buttons), `/new_task <title?>` (inline title creates immediately; bare starts an awaiting-title
  flow), `/cancel`. Callbacks: `task:done:<id>`, `menu:tasks|status|new_task`. DB work uses its own
  `SessionLocal` session scoped to `TELEGRAM_TASK_USER_ID` (default 0, anon bucket — mirrors
  `FINANCE_INGEST_USER_ID`). **Self-heal**: `telegram_webhook_heal_once` + `telegram_webhook_supervisor_loop`
  re-register the webhook when Telegram's recorded URL drifts from `{BACKEND_PUBLIC_URL}/api/telegram/webhook`
  or the pending queue exceeds 100. The whole module fail-opens: unset token ⇒ logged no-op.
- **CHANGE (sync — single transport)** `notification_service.send_telegram` now **delegates** to
  `telegram_service.send_message_sync` (the one `sendMessage` seam) so the critical-event fan-out and
  the bidirectional bot share identical config + no-op-without-token behaviour. Signature + dev no-op
  contract preserved; a defensive inline fallback keeps it working if the new module can't import.
- **CHANGE (routes)** New `app/routes/telegram.py` (absolute `/api/telegram/...`, no prefix, mirrors
  `webhook`/`notifications.api_router`): `POST /webhook` (ALWAYS returns 200 so Telegram never
  retry-storms), `POST /set-webhook` (auto-builds URL from `BACKEND_PUBLIC_URL` when body omits it),
  `POST /delete-webhook`, `POST /heal-webhook`, `GET /status` (config + webhook diag, **never** the
  token), `POST /test`. Registered in `app/main.py`; supervisor started/stopped via a dedicated
  `@app.on_event("startup"|"shutdown")` pair (isolated + reversible).
- **CHANGE (frontend)** New `frontend/src/pages/TelegramSettings.jsx` (RTL): status grid + «ثبت
  webhook / ترمیم webhook / ارسال پیام تست / حذف webhook» + a one-time setup note. Added as a
  «تلگرام» tab in `Settings.jsx`.
- **Dependencies synced (4 directions):** upstream — `httpx` (already pinned), `Task`/`TaskStatus`,
  `NotificationService.get_delivery_status`, `SessionLocal`. downstream — `send_telegram` delegation,
  `TelegramSettings.jsx`, `Settings.jsx` tab, `main.py` router + supervisor. db — NONE (reads/writes
  the existing `tasks`/`notifications` tables; no new table/column, no migration). env — documented
  `BACKEND_PUBLIC_URL`, `TELEGRAM_TASK_USER_ID`, `TELEGRAM_APP_BASE_URL` in `.env.example` and
  expanded the `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`/`TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` note for the bidirectional flow.
- **FIX (bonus, pre-existing)** `test_inventory_lists_all_frontend_pages` was red — 7 pages
  (AdminUsers, AssistantHub, DataHub, DriveSettings, FinanceHub, Import, ProjectsHub) plus the new
  TelegramSettings were missing from `docs/ARCHITECTURE_INVENTORY.json`. Reconciled all 8; the test
  is now green (−1 from the 14-failure baseline).
- **VERIFY** new `tests/test_telegram_bot.py` 24/24 green; existing `test_verify_failed_notification.py`
  6/6 still green (delegation didn't break the fan-out); `inventory_json` 5/5; backend full suite
  **986 passed / 13 pre-existing failed (0 new; −1 from baseline via the inventory fix)** — the 13 are
  the known auth/env-gated failures (`test_auth_required_user_id_*`, `test_lint`, `*mutations_require_authentication`,
  …) present on a clean tree before this change. `npm run build` clean; frontend `Settings.test.jsx` 3/3.
- **TODO (owner — see chat summary)** set `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` + `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` + `BACKEND_PUBLIC_URL`
  on Render, then open Settings → «تلگرام» → «ثبت webhook» (or just wait one self-heal cycle).

## 2026-06-28 — Unify notifications + Telegram into one hub; add real notification preferences

- **DECISION** Owner: the «اعلان‌ها» and «تلگرام» settings tabs should be **one** (with room for
  email later), and — like PROJECT-MANAGEMENT — there should be a way to set **per-event** "send
  or not / sound or not" and per-channel routing, which this project lacked (the old toggles only
  wrote `localStorage` and never reached the backend). Built both, behaviour-preserving.
- **CHANGE (prefs service)** New `app/services/notification_prefs.py`: a JSON blob in the EXISTING
  `global_settings` table (key `notification_prefs`) — **no new table / no migration**, survives
  Render's ephemeral FS (a file would not). A process-wide cache (warmed at startup, refreshed on
  save) backs DB-free predicates `event_enabled` / `event_sound` / `channel_enabled` /
  `priority_allowed`. `EVENT_CATALOG` (verify_failed, budget_alert, budget_affordable, task_done,
  recommendation, ai_feedback, login_succeeded — Persian labels + help) and `CHANNEL_CATALOG`
  (in_app always-on, telegram, email) drive the UI. **Defaults reproduce the prior "always send,
  always loud, telegram on" behaviour**, so an unconfigured install is unchanged.
- **CHANGE (notify_event gating)** `app/services/notification_service.py`: `notify_event` now
  consults prefs — disabled event ⇒ returns None (nothing sent); priority < `min_priority` ⇒ skip;
  `silent` default changed `False`→`None` so an unset caller resolves silent from the sound pref
  (explicit `silent=True/False` callers unchanged). Telegram fan-out additionally gated on
  `channel_enabled("telegram")`; added an **email** fan-out gated on `channel_enabled("email")` +
  `NOTIFICATION_EMAIL_TO` (via the existing `send_email`). `verify_failed`/`budget_alert` registered
  with an `email` channel too. All best-effort: a prefs glitch degrades to "send anyway", never blocks.
- **CHANGE (routes)** `app/routes/notifications.py` (api_router, absolute paths): `GET/PUT
  /api/notifications/preferences` (load→cache / deep-merged partial save) and `POST
  /api/notifications/test` (`channel: in_app|telegram|email`). `app/main.py` startup hook warms the
  prefs cache from `global_settings`.
- **CHANGE (frontend — the unification)** `Notifications.jsx` rewritten into a **unified hub**:
  server-backed channel cards (in-app always-on; Telegram master toggle + the embedded
  `TelegramSettings` webhook panel in a `<details>`; email toggle + SMTP note), a min-priority
  selector, and a per-event table with **«ارسال» + «صدا»** switches — all persisting via
  `PUT /api/notifications/preferences` (replaces the localStorage-only toggles). The standalone
  «تلگرام» tab was **folded into** «اعلان‌ها» (`Settings.jsx`); `TelegramSettings.jsx` is kept and
  reused as the Telegram channel section (capability preserved, rule 2). The
  `data-testid="notification-settings"` anchor is retained so `Settings.test.jsx` stays green.
- **Dependencies synced (4 directions):** upstream — `GlobalSetting`, `NotificationService`,
  `send_telegram`/`send_email`/`get_telegram_bot`. downstream — `notify_event` gating, the
  preferences/test routes, `Notifications.jsx`, `Settings.jsx` (tab removed), startup cache warm.
  db — NONE (reuses `global_settings`; no new table/column/migration). env — documented
  `NOTIFICATION_EMAIL_TO` in `.env.example`.
- **VERIFY** new `tests/test_notification_prefs.py` 15/15 (defaults, roundtrip, predicates, the four
  notify_event gates, routes); existing `test_verify_failed_notification.py` 6/6 still green (defaults
  preserve the fan-out); backend full suite **1001 passed / 13 pre-existing failed (0 new)**; ruff
  clean on all new/changed files; `npm run build` clean; `Settings.test.jsx` 3/3.
- **EXPERIENCE** recorded `experiences/notification-channel-event-preferences.md`.

## 2026-06-28 — Tiered-storage task 7367c6f0 re-audit: complete AC5 (download Drive bytes)

- **REVIEW** Owner resent the original tiered-storage spec (Drive/Sheets as the cold store, audit
  task 7367c6f0). Verified every AC against the actual repo (paths in the auto-generated prompt
  used a `backend/app/...` layout that does not match lifemanager's `app/...`; mapped by behaviour,
  not filename):
  - **AC1** ✓ `google_drive_service.upload_file` returns a shareable link (real client now wired).
  - **AC2** ✓ `sheets_service.append_index_row`/`record_index_entry` → `LifeManagerIndex` (real
    `GoogleSheetsClient` find-or-creates the sheet).
  - **AC3** ✓ `DriveFile` (lifemanager's FileRecord) has storage_location/drive_file_id/drive_link/
    extracted_text (+ storage_tier/last_accessed_at/migrated_at).
  - **AC4** ✓ `cold_tiering_service` 30-day policy + Celery `tier-cold-data-daily`, real mover wired.
  - **AC6** ✓ audio/image text extracted into `extracted_text` on upload.
  - **AC7** ✓ `LifeManagerData` root + audio/images/documents/migrated_data subfolders (`ensure_app_folders`).
  - **AC8** ✓ frontend badge + download link (`DriveFiles.jsx`); + upload control (added earlier today).
  Did NOT rebuild any of the above — they were already implemented (prior 7367c6f0 work + today's
  Drive connection integration).
- **FINDING (the one real gap)** **AC5** ("باید بتونم فراخوانیش کنم و ببینمش") was only partially
  met: `GET /api/files/{id}` and `/raw` returned the Drive *link*, never streamed the bytes through
  the app, and the `google_drive_service.download_file` seam (+ `GoogleDriveClient.download`) was
  unused by any route — a dangling downstream dependency.
- **CHANGE (additive — completes AC5)** `app/routes/files.py`: new `GET /api/files/{id}/download`
  that, for a Drive-tiered file, streams the REAL bytes from Google Drive via the `download_file`
  seam when connected; degrades to a 302 to the share link when Drive is offline; and for a local
  file returns its extracted-text body. The existing `/api/files/{id}` + `/raw` routes are untouched
  (behaviour-preserving; their tests stay green).
- **Dependencies synced (4 directions):** upstream — `download_file` seam, `build_drive_client`,
  `drive_settings_service`, `DriveFile`. downstream — none broke (new route is additive; existing
  files/raw routes + `drive_files.test.jsx` href contract untouched). cross-tier backend→frontend —
  none required (the UI's existing `drive_link` download still works for the owner; the new streaming
  route is available for clients that prefer app-proxied download). db — NONE (no schema change).
  infra/env — none. side — AUDIT_LOG + experiences Update. **No Manual-required part → no TO-DO file.**
- **VERIFY** backend full suite **964 passed / 14 pre-existing failed (0 new)**; Drive suite 26/26
  (incl. 3 new download tests); `npm run build` clean; ruff clean on changed files.

## 2026-06-28 — Dynamic task-aware AI feedback (task e606cca6 re-audit): surface the existing engine in the UI

- **REVIEW** Owner resent the "dynamic, non-hardcoded AI that knows my tasks, reacts to what I've
  done/need to do, and sends intelligent feedback into notifications — within the prompt I write in
  Settings, no token limit, cost no object" spec. Auto-generated prompt assumed a `backend/app/...`
  + OpenAI + `.tsx` + WebSocket layout that does NOT match this repo; mapped every AC to behaviour.
- **FINDING — the feature is already fully built (task e606cca6 + 1a08ded2) and green.** Verified by
  running the suites, did NOT rebuild:
  - AC1 (per-model `context_type`/`dynamic_response`/`token_limit`/`prompt_template`) → `AIModelConfig`
    columns + `ai_schema` fields — `test_ai_model_config_has_context_fields`/`…_prompt_template_column`.
  - AC2 (`get_task_context` → total/completed/pending/overdue) → `app/services/task_analysis.py`.
  - AC4 (`POST /api/ai/analyze-tasks`) → `app/routes/ai.py` (context + analysis + feedback +
    persists via `send_ai_feedback`).
  - AC5 (`send_ai_feedback` → notification) → `notification_service.send_ai_feedback` → `notify_event("ai_feedback")`.
  - AC6 (`analyze_user_tasks` groups + patterns) → `app/services/task_analysis.py`.
  - AC7 (WebSocket `/ws/ai-stream`) → `app/routes/ai_stream.py`.
  - "dynamic, within my prompt, NO token limit" → `app/services/ai/task_feedback.py` merges the
    user's `GlobalAnalysisPrompt` + full task context + patterns and sends the WHOLE thing (the
    `test_dynamic_analyze_sends_full_prompt_not_truncated` pins the no-1000-char-clip behaviour);
    real LLM via `inference_gateway.complete` (Anthropic/OpenAI/Gemini), offline placeholder fallback.
  - Settings UI (`AISettings.jsx`): provider keys, per-task model routing, and the editable analysis
    prompt box. 43 backend + 6 frontend AI tests already green.
- **FINDING — the one real gap (cross-tier, frontend):** NO page called `POST /api/ai/analyze-tasks`
  (grep of `frontend/src`), so the task-aware feedback engine, though complete + persisting to the
  bell, was **never triggerable from the app**. SmartAssistant only called `/v1/context/analyze`
  (a different context engine); there was no scheduler either.
- **CHANGE (additive — completes the surface)** `frontend/src/pages/SmartAssistant.jsx`: added a
  «بازخورد هوشمند روی تسک‌ها» panel — a button that POSTs `/ai/analyze-tasks`, renders the returned
  feedback + the context counts (کل/انجام‌شده/در انتظار/عقب‌افتاده), and notes the result is also
  saved to the notification bell. The existing context-analyze panel is untouched.
- **Dependencies synced (4 directions):** upstream — the existing `/api/ai/analyze-tasks` endpoint
  (no change needed). downstream — new test `SmartAssistantTaskFeedback.test.jsx`; existing
  `MorePages.test.jsx` SmartAssistant test still green (different testid, untouched path). cross-tier
  frontend→backend — none required (consumes the already-shipped, already-tested endpoint). db —
  NONE. env — NONE. side — AUDIT_LOG. **No Manual-required part → no TO-DO file.**
- **VERIFY** no backend change → backend stays **1004 passed / 13 pre-existing failed (0 new)**;
  `npm run build` clean; new panel test 1/1 + existing SmartAssistant test 2/2 green.

## 2026-06-28 — Context-aware recommendations (task 2165524b re-audit): close the real gaps

- **REVIEW** Owner resent the "proactive, context-aware assistant" spec (location+Maps → "you're
  near a shop where you can get the item you registered"; heart-rate/idle/mood → suggestions;
  analyze on a configurable interval; surface in notifications). The whole engine already exists +
  is tested (task 2165524b): UserContext/ContextualRecommendation models, recommendation_engine,
  google_maps_service (key-gated geocode/nearby), /api/context/location, /api/recommendations,
  LocationTracker.jsx (mounted in Layout, pings every 5 min), RecommendationPanel with accept/reject,
  the `recommendation` notification event, and a celery beat job. Did NOT rebuild it (37 tests green).
- **FINDING — four genuine gaps that matched the voice intent (completed, not rebuilt):**
  (a) location branch never named the registered item ("موردی از لیست‌تان" generic);
  (c) no idle auto-detection from a stale last_activity_time;
  (d)+(i) the scheduled job ran ContextOrchestrator().analyze({}) (no per-user work) and the
  registered `recommendation` notification event was never fired;
  (h) the analysis interval was hard-coded at */15 with no env knob.
- **CHANGE (engine)** `recommendation_engine.py`: the location branch loads the caller's OPEN tasks
  and matches each nearby place to one (geo-proximity ~300m, else title↔name keyword overlap) →
  "نزدیک «X» هستید — می‌توانید «<item>» را همین‌جا انجام دهید." + matched task_id (generic fallback
  kept). Idle now inferred from a stale last_activity_time (CONTEXT_IDLE_MINUTES, default 60) as well
  as the explicit flag. Empty context still returns [] (regression-pinned).
- **CHANGE (route)** `routes/context.py` GET /api/recommendations passes last_activity_time (ISO,
  JSON-safe) so on-demand calls also get idle inference.
- **CHANGE (scheduled loop + notifications)** `tasks.py::analyze_user_context` keeps the DB-free
  orchestrator self-check (suggestions>=1 contract preserved) AND iterates every UserContext, runs
  the engine per user, and fires ONE silent in-app `recommendation` notification per user with the
  freshest rec (best-effort; missing DB → clean no-op). Returns {suggestions, users_analyzed,
  recommendations}.
- **CHANGE (configurable interval)** `celery_app.py` reads CONTEXT_ANALYSIS_INTERVAL_MINUTES
  (default 15) for the beat cadence; `config.py` adds CONTEXT_ANALYSIS_INTERVAL_MINUTES +
  CONTEXT_IDLE_MINUTES; documented both in `.env.example`.
- **Dependencies synced (4 directions):** upstream — Task(status/location_lat/lng/title), UserContext,
  find_nearby_places, notify_event("recommendation"), SessionLocal. downstream — /api/recommendations
  route + celery beat entry; existing engine/celery/location tests stay green (location text wasn't
  pinned; suggestions>=1 preserved). cross-tier backend→frontend — none (existing RecommendationPanel/
  NotificationBell/LocationTracker consume the richer text + real notifications through unchanged
  contracts). db — NONE (ContextualRecommendation.task_id already existed; no migration). infra/env —
  .env.example + config. side — AUDIT_LOG + experiences. No Manual-required part → no TO-DO file.
- **VERIFY** backend full suite **1012 passed / 13 pre-existing failed (0 new)**; new
  tests/test_context_reco_completion.py 8/8 + existing context/celery/location suites green;
  `npm run build` clean; ruff clean on all changed files.

## 2026-06-28 — FIX: Claude subscription (OAuth token) test → 401 Unauthorized

- **FINDING** Owner tested the "Claude (اشتراک · OAuth token)" provider (Claude Opus 4.8) on the AI
  settings page and got `HTTPStatusError: 401 Unauthorized for url 'https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages'`.
  Root cause: a Claude Pro/Max **OAuth** token is only accepted on `/v1/messages` when the request
  carries `anthropic-beta: oauth-2025-04-20` (alongside `Authorization: Bearer …` and the Claude-Code
  system spoof). The code set the Bearer header + the system spoof but **omitted the oauth beta
  header**, so Anthropic rejected the subscription token with 401. The API-key path (`x-api-key`) was
  unaffected.
- **CHANGE** `app/services/ai/inference_gateway.py`: `_anthropic_text` now adds
  `anthropic-beta: oauth-2025-04-20` when `auth_scheme == "oauth_bearer"`; `_anthropic_multimodal`
  combines it with the existing pdfs beta (`oauth-2025-04-20,pdfs-2024-09-25`).
  `app/services/ai/catalog_tester.py::_list_models` adds the same beta to the model-discovery GET
  (`/v1/models`) so "دریافت مدل‌ها" works for the subscription provider too. API-key callers unchanged.
- **Dependencies synced (4 directions):** upstream — `ResolvedModel.auth_scheme`, `CLAUDE_CODE_SYSTEM`,
  the `claude_subscription` provider (auth_scheme=oauth_bearer, env_key=CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN).
  downstream — both Anthropic text/multimodal callers + the tester ping/discovery; new
  `tests/test_anthropic_oauth_header.py` (oauth beta+bearer present, api-key path unchanged). db/env —
  NONE. cross-tier — none (the frontend test button + AISettings consume the same `/ai/models/{id}/test`
  contract, now returning OK instead of 401 when the token is valid). side — AUDIT_LOG + experiences.
  **No Manual-required code part → no TO-DO** (the operator still supplies a valid, non-expired token).
- **NOTE (operator)** Subscription OAuth access tokens are short-lived (~hours) and must be a real
  Claude-Code OAuth token (starts `sk-ant-oat01-…`, via `claude setup-token`). If 401 persists after
  this fix, the stored token is invalid/expired — regenerate and paste it again, or use a normal
  `sk-ant-api03-…` API key on the plain "Anthropic" provider instead.
- **VERIFY** new `tests/test_anthropic_oauth_header.py` 2/2; `tests/test_ai_catalog.py` 7/7; backend
  full suite **1014 passed / 13 pre-existing failed (0 new)**; `npm run build` clean; ruff clean.

## 2026-06-28 — FIX (real root cause): Claude OAuth 401 needs a Claude-CLI user-agent

- **FINDING** The earlier oauth-beta-header fix was necessary but NOT sufficient — the owner still
  got 401 on the subscription provider's test. Compared against ALLIN1 (where this exact 401 was
  already solved): `backend/app/ai/inference.py` line 102 / `tester.py` line 94 set an extra header
  on OAuth requests — **`user-agent: claude-cli/1.0 (external)`**. Anthropic rejects a Claude
  subscription OAuth token with **401** when the request's User-Agent looks like a generic HTTP
  client (httpx's default `python-httpx/…`); it must present as the Claude CLI. The owner correctly
  insisted it wasn't the token.
- **CHANGE** Added `user-agent: claude-cli/1.0 (external)` to every OAuth (`oauth_bearer`) Anthropic
  call in lifemanager: `inference_gateway._anthropic_text`, `_anthropic_multimodal`, and
  `catalog_tester._list_models` (model discovery). The api-key (`x-api-key`) path is unchanged (no
  bearer, no beta, no spoofed user-agent). This brings lifemanager to parity with ALLIN1's working
  OAuth implementation (Bearer + `anthropic-beta: oauth-2025-04-20` + Claude-CLI user-agent + the
  `CLAUDE_CODE_SYSTEM` first system block — the constant is byte-identical across both repos).
- **Dependencies synced (4 directions):** upstream — ALLIN1 reference impl, `CLAUDE_CODE_SYSTEM`,
  `ResolvedModel.auth_scheme`. downstream — all three Anthropic OAuth call sites + `test_anthropic_oauth_header.py`
  (now also asserts the user-agent on the oauth path and its absence on the api-key path). db/env —
  NONE. cross-tier — none (same `/ai/models/{id}/test` contract; the «تست» button now succeeds with a
  valid token). side — AUDIT_LOG + experiences Update. No Manual code part → no TO-DO.
- **VERIFY** `tests/test_anthropic_oauth_header.py` 2/2; `tests/test_ai_catalog.py` 7/7; backend full
  suite green (0 new failures); ruff clean.

## 2026-06-28 — Surface the provider's real error body on the AI "test" (still-401 follow-up)

- **FINDING** After matching ALLIN1's OAuth headers exactly (Bearer + anthropic-beta:oauth-2025-04-20
  + claude-cli user-agent + Claude-Code system spoof), the owner still saw 401. lifemanager's
  `catalog_tester.test_model` only reported `HTTPStatusError: 401 Unauthorized` — it **discarded
  Anthropic's response body**, which carries the actual reason (`authentication_error` /
  model / credit / account). ALLIN1 surfaces that body; lifemanager didn't, so the real cause was
  invisible — making it impossible to tell a code bug from a bad/expired token.
- **CHANGE** `app/services/ai/catalog_tester.py::test_model` now extracts the provider error body
  (`error.type` + `error.message`, else the raw text, truncated) and appends it to the test message.
  The «تست» button will now show e.g. `… 401 — authentication_error: <reason>` instead of a generic
  status. Diagnostic-only; no behaviour change to the call itself.
- **Dependencies synced:** upstream — httpx HTTPStatusError shape. downstream — the `/ai/models/{id}/test`
  response message (richer string; same schema). db/env/cross-tier — none. No Manual code part → no TO-DO.
- **VERIFY** `tests/test_ai_catalog.py` 7/7 + `tests/test_anthropic_oauth_header.py` 2/2; ruff clean.

## 2026-06-28 — FIX: Claude Opus 4.x rejects `temperature` (the 401 was actually solved)

- **FINDING** With the error body now surfaced, the «تست» error changed from `401 Unauthorized`
  to **`400 invalid_request_error: 'temperature' is deprecated for this model'`**. That CONFIRMS the
  OAuth auth fix worked (Bearer + oauth beta + claude-cli user-agent + system spoof got past 401) —
  the remaining failure was the request sending `temperature`, which the newer Anthropic models
  (Claude Opus 4.x) reject. The tester pinged with `temperature=0.0`, so the connectivity test
  always 400'd on those models.
- **CHANGE** `app/services/ai/inference_gateway.py`: new `_anthropic_post` helper wraps the
  `/v1/messages` POST with one **self-healing retry** — on a `400` whose body mentions
  `temperature`, it drops `temperature` from the payload and retries once (used by both
  `_anthropic_text` and `_anthropic_multimodal`). `app/services/ai/catalog_tester.py`: the
  connectivity pings now pass `temperature=None` (a ping needs no temperature). Net: the test
  button succeeds, and real inference no longer breaks if a temperature is configured on a model
  that deprecates it.
- **Dependencies synced (4 directions):** upstream — httpx response shape, the Anthropic 400 error
  body. downstream — `_anthropic_text`/`_anthropic_multimodal` (both route through `_anthropic_post`),
  the three tester pings, `test_anthropic_oauth_header.py` (+ retry-drops-temperature test). db/env/
  cross-tier — none. No Manual code part → no TO-DO.
- **VERIFY** `tests/test_anthropic_oauth_header.py` 3/3 (oauth headers, temperature-retry, api-key
  path) + `tests/test_ai_catalog.py` 7/7; backend full suite green (0 new); ruff clean.

## 2026-06-28 — FIX: /api/context/location 409 (anon scope had no FK anchor)

- **FINDING** Owner's console showed `POST /api/context/location 409 (Conflict)` (the LocationTracker
  ping that fires every 5 min). Root cause: per-user tables (user_contexts, tasks, contextual_recommendations,
  finance, drive_files) carry `user_id → users.id` FK; anonymous / Google-OAuth traffic resolves to
  `DEFAULT_ANON_USER_ID = 0`, so an anon write inserts `user_id=0`, which violates the FK on Postgres
  when no `users` row id=0 exists. `@handle_errors` maps the resulting IntegrityError to 409. (Hidden
  on SQLite, which doesn't enforce FKs by default — so tests were green.) This is the exact 409 the
  auth module's docstring had warned about.
- **CHANGE (root cause)** `app/main.py` startup: idempotently seed a non-loginable anchor row
  `users(id=0, email='anon@lifemanager.local', username='anon', hashed_password='!')` via
  `INSERT … ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING`. Makes EVERY anon-scoped FK write valid (context, tasks,
  finance, drive, recommendations), so anon context now persists and location-based recs can fire.
  id=0 never collides with the serial sequence (starts at 1); '!' is not a valid bcrypt hash so the
  row can't be logged into.
- **CHANGE (belt-and-suspenders)** `app/routes/context.py::save_context_location` now catches
  IntegrityError on commit → rollback → returns a soft `{"status":"skipped"}` 200 instead of letting
  it become a 409. So the background ping never spams the console even in a deploy/seed race.
- **Dependencies synced (4 directions):** upstream — `users` table schema, `DEFAULT_ANON_USER_ID`,
  `@handle_errors` IntegrityError→409. downstream — `/api/context/location` (soft-ack path), the
  LocationTracker (no behaviour change client-side); new `tests/test_context_location_resilience.py`.
  db — NONE (no schema change; a DATA seed row, idempotent). cross-tier — none (the frontend ping
  contract is unchanged; it just stops 409-ing). env — none. No Manual code part → no TO-DO.
- **VERIFY** new `tests/test_context_location_resilience.py` 2/2 + context suites green; backend full
  suite green (0 new); ruff clean. (The seed runs only against the live Postgres engine; tests use the
  SQLite override so it's a no-op there.)

## 2026-06-28 — Telegram compose: media burst (voice/photo/doc/video) → one AI-analysed task

- **DECISION** Owner: make the bot handle attachments exactly like PROJECT-MANAGEMENT — send a
  voice/photo/document (or several), have it **analyse all of them in order**, detect first-ness/
  priority, **extract**, convert into a task (or route to a list), and **activate the vision model
  when needed**. **Honest review of the prior state:** the bot was two-way for *text commands only* —
  `handle_update` read `message.text` and **dropped all media** (no analysis, no transcription, no
  vision, no routing). Built the full compose pipeline, adapted to this app + its AI layer.
- **KEY ADAPTATION** This app's `complete_multimodal` already **auto-resolves a vision/documents
  model by capability** (`need="vision"|"documents"`) — so "activate the vision model when needed"
  is built-in; we did NOT need PROJECT-MANAGEMENT's manual `temp_activate_model` machinery. Audio/
  video transcribe when the resolved model is audio-capable (Gemini passes any mime as inline_data);
  otherwise the item degrades to a labelled placeholder (graceful, per this repo's philosophy).
- **CHANGE (compose service)** New `app/services/telegram_compose.py`: `ComposeService` with
  `detect_media` (voice/audio/photo[-largest]/document/video/video_note/animation), an in-memory
  per-chat **ordered** buffer (`ComposeItem.order`, TTL 30min, max 25), `render_status` (live
  "📦 N پیوست + M متن" list), and the `submit` pipeline → `_analyse_items` (download each via the
  bot, run `complete_multimodal` per type with Persian transcribe/extract prompts, collect the
  models used + a per-item ✅/⚠️ report) → `_structure_task` (text model → strict-JSON
  {title,description,priority,target,list_name,due_date}; fallback builds a task from the raw text,
  skipping section-header lines) → `_create` (a `Task`, or a `TodoItem` linked to a `TodoList`
  matched by name). Scoped to `TELEGRAM_TASK_USER_ID`. Fail-open throughout.
- **CHANGE (bot I/O)** `app/services/telegram_service.py`: added `download_file` (getFile →
  /file/bot…, 20MB cap), `get_file_path`, `edit_message_text` (in-place status, swallows
  "not modified"); `send` now returns `message_id`. `handle_update` restructured so media is
  routed BEFORE the text path (attachments carry no `message.text`): new `_maybe_route_to_compose`
  (+ `_refresh_compose_status`) buffers media / compose-keyboard taps / text-while-composing, while
  **commands and persistent-keyboard taps are explicitly NOT swallowed**. `/cancel` now also clears
  an active compose; `/help` documents the attachment flow.
- **Dependencies synced (4 directions):** upstream — `complete`/`complete_multimodal`/`ai_manager`
  (capability routing), `parse`-style JSON, `Task`/`TaskPriority`/`TodoList`/`TodoItem`/
  `todo_list_items`, `SessionLocal`, the bot's new download/edit methods. downstream — `handle_update`
  routing, `/help`, `/cancel`. db — NONE (reuses tasks + todo_items/todo_lists; no new table/migration).
  env — none new (reuses `TELEGRAM_TASK_USER_ID`; AI keys via the existing catalog).
- **VERIFY** new `tests/test_telegram_compose.py` 9/9 (detect_media, ordered buffer, render_status,
  handle_update routing incl. "command not swallowed", full submit with mocked AI+download over a
  StaticPool in-memory DB, and the AI-unavailable fallback); existing `test_telegram_bot.py` 24/24
  still green; backend full suite **1010 passed / 13 pre-existing failed (0 new)**; ruff clean on all
  new/changed files; `npm run build` unaffected (no frontend change this round).
- **EXPERIENCE** merged an `## Update 2026-06-28` section into
  `experiences/bidirectional-telegram-bot-webhook.md` (the multimodal compose pattern + its pitfalls).
- **LIMITATION (documented)** Voice/video transcription needs an audio-capable model configured (e.g.
  a Gemini key with a vision model); with only an Anthropic/OpenAI vision model, images/PDFs analyse
  but audio degrades to a placeholder. Buffer is in-memory (single-replica), lost on restart mid-compose.

## 2026-06-28 — Compose intelligence: list-aware routing + dedup/strengthen-existing

- **DECISION** Owner asked whether compose actually (a) knows WHICH real list to file an item under,
  and (b) detects an existing similar item and STRENGTHENS/updates it instead of duplicating. **Honest
  prior state:** (a) the AI guessed a `list_name` blind (no sight of the user's real lists) → an
  `ilike` fuzzy-match that usually missed → fell back to a bare task; (b) there was NO dedup — it
  always created new. Built both properly.
- **CHANGE (list-aware + dedup structuring)** `app/services/telegram_compose.py`: new `_gather_context`
  feeds the structuring model the user's ACTUAL lists (sections) + recent open tasks + recent list
  items (bounded: 80 lists / 40 tasks / 40 items). The `_STRUCTURE_PROMPT` now returns
  `action: create|update`, `update_target_kind: task|todo_item`, `update_target_id`, plus the task
  fields, and `list_name` must resolve to a REAL list (else null). A guard rejects any
  `update_target_id` NOT in the offered candidate set (no hallucinated-row writes).
- **CHANGE (apply: create OR strengthen)** `_create` → `_apply`: on `action=update` it loads the
  chosen Task/TodoItem and **strengthens** it — `_merge_description` does an AI merge of the existing
  description + the new input (deterministic labelled-append fallback when AI is down; never loses the
  old text), raises priority only upward, fills an empty due_date. Otherwise it creates a Task, or a
  `TodoItem` linked to the matched list. Confirmation message distinguishes "ساخته شد" vs "تقویت و
  به‌روزرسانی شد".
- **Dependencies synced (4 directions):** upstream — `Task`/`TaskStatus`/`TaskPriority`, `TodoItem`,
  `TodoList(.is_archived)`, `complete`. downstream — `submit` confirmation copy. db — NONE (reads/updates
  existing rows; no schema change). env — none.
- **VERIFY** 3 new tests in `tests/test_telegram_compose.py` (route into an existing list; update +
  strengthen an existing task via merge; hallucinated update-id guard → falls back to create) — file now
  12/12; backend full suite **1029 passed / 13 pre-existing failed (0 new)**; ruff clean; `npm run build`
  unaffected (no frontend change).
- **LIMITATION** Dedup quality depends on a configured text model + the candidate window (recent 40
  open tasks / 40 items); older items outside the window won't be matched. List routing needs the AI
  to pick from the names shown — with no AI key it always creates a plain task (fail-open).

## 2026-06-28 — Compose: full-coverage matching + manual target picker + Google Drive file archiving

- **DECISION** Owner: (1) why only "recent 40" — it should identify items across the WHOLE app (it
  has DB access); (2) besides auto, add a MANUAL mode to pick from a Telegram list which item to
  add-to/strengthen; (3) every analysed file should also be uploaded to Google Drive (proper title,
  reference, folder) and its link attached to the created/strengthened item. Built all three.
- **CHANGE (full coverage)** `telegram_compose._gather_context(session, uid, raw_idea)`: the "recent
  40" cap was only the prompt-size budget, never a DB limit. Now it keyword-searches **every** open
  task / list item (`ILIKE` over `_keywords(raw_idea)`, up to 120 each) ∪ the 25 most-recent, ranks
  by keyword-overlap, and keeps the top 40 for the AI — so a long-ago item is still found when
  relevant. Lists raised to 200.
- **CHANGE (manual picker)** A second compose button «🎯 انتخاب مقصد» (`COMPOSE_BTN_PICK`) →
  `submit(mode="manual")`: analyses, then sends an inline keyboard of the most-relevant existing
  tasks/items + lists + «🆕 کار جدید» (`cmp:t|i|l|new`), keeping the buffer alive. The tap →
  `_handle_callback` `cmp:*` → `ComposeService.apply_choice`, which overrides the draft's target and
  runs the shared `_finish`. «✅ ساخت خودکار» stays the auto path.
- **CHANGE (Google Drive archiving)** `_attach_drive`: every downloaded file (`ComposeItem.data`, now
  retained) is uploaded via the EXISTING Drive client (`build_clients` → `ensure_app_folders` →
  `get_or_create_folder("telegram")` → `upload` → `share_link`) under `LifeManagerData/telegram/`
  with a title-derived safe filename (`<task>__<order>__<orig>`); `_append_links_to_row` writes the
  share links into the created/strengthened row's description and sets `Task.attachment` to the first
  link. Fail-open: Drive not connected ⇒ skipped + a one-line note in the reply. Reuses the existing
  Drive OAuth connection (Settings → گوگل درایو); no new credentials.
- **CHANGE (refactor)** `submit` split into `submit(mode)` → `_send_target_picker` / `_finish`
  (shared apply + Drive + confirm + clear); `apply_choice` for the manual tap; `_keywords` /
  `_safe_name` helpers. Confirmation now lists the Drive links + create-vs-strengthen wording.
- **Dependencies synced (4 directions):** upstream — `google_api_client.build_clients/ensure_app_folders/
  GoogleDriveClient(upload/get_or_create_folder/share_link)`, `Task.attachment`, `Task`/`TodoItem`,
  the bot's download bytes. downstream — `telegram_service` PICK button + `cmp:*` callbacks, `_finish`
  confirmation. db — NONE (reuses tasks/todo_items + `global_settings` Drive connection; no schema
  change). env — none new (Drive via existing `GOOGLE_*`).
- **VERIFY** 3 new tests in `tests/test_telegram_compose.py` (full-coverage keyword find of an
  out-of-recent-window task; manual pick → strengthen the chosen task; Drive upload attaches the
  share link to the task description + `attachment`) → file 15/15; backend full suite **1032 passed /
  13 pre-existing failed (0 new)**; ruff clean; `npm run build` unaffected.
- **LIMITATION** Drive upload needs the Drive connection (Settings → گوگل درایو) + the bot's file ≤
  20MB (Telegram). Keyword matching is substring `ILIKE` (no stemming) — good for Persian/English
  tokens ≥3 chars; very short/heavily-inflected matches may be missed. Manual picker shows the top
  5 tasks / 5 items / 8 lists by relevance.

## 2026-06-28 — Fix: route /new_task + plain text through the intelligent compose flow; show destination + model

- **FINDING (owner screenshot)** Tapping «🆕 کار جدید» then typing a sentence created a bare task with
  NO auto/manual buttons, NO "where did it go", NO model — because `/new_task` (and the `menu:new_task`
  callback) used the legacy `awaiting_title` → `_create_task` path, which bypasses the whole compose
  pipeline. Plain non-command text hit a dead-end "متوجه نشدم" nudge. So all three of the owner's
  complaints (no options / no destination / no model) traced to text never entering compose, plus the
  compose confirmation only surfaced the *vision* model (media), never the *text* routing model.
- **CHANGE (entry points → compose)** `telegram_service`: bare `/new_task`, the `menu:new_task`
  callback, AND any plain non-command text now call a new `_start_compose_flow(chat_id, initial_text?)`
  — it opens a compose session (optionally seeding the typed text as the first item) and shows the
  auto/manual reply keyboard, so the user always sees BOTH «✅ ساخت خودکار» and «🎯 انتخاب مقصد»
  before anything is created. Inline `/new_task <title>` still fast-creates (capability preserved); the
  legacy `awaiting_title` handler is kept as a fallback.
- **CHANGE (show model + destination)** `telegram_compose`: `_structure_task` now returns `_model`
  (the text model that did the routing/dedup) and `submit` adds it to `models_used`, so the
  confirmation reports the model even for text-only tasks. `_finish` now ALWAYS prints an explicit
  «🗂 مقصد:» line (🆕 کار مستقل / 📋 لیست «…» / تقویتِ کار موجود #id) and, when no model ran, an
  honest «ℹ️ بدون تحلیل هوش مصنوعی (کلید مدل تنظیم نشده)» note.
- **Dependencies synced (4 directions):** upstream — `complete().model`, compose service. downstream —
  `/new_task` + `menu:new_task` + plain-text path, `_finish` confirmation. db — NONE. env — none.
- **VERIFY** updated 3 tests + added 1 (`test_text_only_auto_shows_destination_and_model`,
  `test_new_task_bare_starts_compose`, `test_plain_text_starts_compose_with_that_text`,
  `test_callback_menu_new_task_starts_compose`); added a compose-singleton reset fixture to
  `test_telegram_bot.py`. telegram_bot 24/24 + compose 16/16; backend full suite **1033 passed / 13
  pre-existing failed (0 new)**; ruff clean.

## 2026-06-28 — Compose model routing is automatic by CAPABILITY (not hard-coded to Gemini); proper audio capability

- **FINDING (owner)** "I already enabled my Claude token — it must be automatic, not hard-coded to
  Gemini; any enabled model with vision/etc. should be accepted." Correct on both counts. **Reality
  check:** text + image + PDF already auto-resolve to ANY enabled, capable model — Claude
  (`vision`+`documents`) is picked automatically by `ai_manager.resolve` (highest-priority configured
  model); nothing was Gemini-hard-coded. The screenshot's "no model" was the OLD `/new_task`→bare path
  (fixed in the previous entry). The ONE real defect: **audio/video was routed as a `vision` task**, so
  it resolved to Claude (which has vision but cannot read audio) and failed — making it *look* like
  only Gemini works.
- **CHANGE (audio capability)** `app/services/ai/catalog.py`: added an `audio` capability and tagged
  the Gemini models with it (the providers that actually accept audio inline). The idempotent seed
  refreshes catalog-model capabilities on every boot, so existing installs gain it automatically.
- **CHANGE (capability-correct routing)** `inference_gateway.complete_multimodal`: `need` is now
  derived from the file mime — audio/video ⇒ `audio`, PDF ⇒ `documents`, else ⇒ `vision`. So an audio
  file resolves to ANY enabled model carrying the `audio` capability (Gemini today, anything added
  later) and never silently mis-routes to a vision-only model. Images/PDF behaviour unchanged.
- **CHANGE (precise message)** `telegram_compose._analyse_items`: the "not analysed" note is now
  capability-specific — for audio/video it says "هیچ مدلِ فعالی قابلیت «صوت» ندارد — یک مدل با قابلیت
  صوت فعال کن (مثلاً Gemini؛ مدل‌های Claude صوت را پشتیبانی نمی‌کنند)"; for image/doc it points at a
  vision model. No more vague "this file type".
- **Dependencies synced (4 directions):** upstream — `catalog` capability list + Gemini caps, seed
  capability-refresh, `ai_manager.capable_models`. downstream — `complete_multimodal` need-routing,
  compose analysis message. db — NONE (seed updates existing catalog rows in place; no schema change).
  env — none (AI keys via the AI catalog / AISettings).
- **VERIFY** new `tests/test_inference_multimodal_routing.py` 4/4 (audio→audio, video→audio,
  image→vision, pdf→documents); `test_ai_catalog.py` 7/7 (uses subset assertions, unaffected by the
  new capability); compose 16/16; backend full suite **1037 passed / 13 pre-existing failed (0 new)**;
  ruff clean.
- **CLARIFICATION for the owner** Text/image/PDF analysis works with your Claude automatically. Audio
  transcription is a genuine model limitation — Claude has no audio input; enable any audio-capable
  model (e.g. Gemini) and the bot will pick it for voice on its own. Nothing is Gemini-only by design.

## 2026-07-10 — Personal-development Excel archive imported (7 sheets → lists + finance)

- **DECISION** Owner uploaded his legacy personal-development workbook (7 sheets, ~1,300 populated
  rows) with a hard requirement: **nothing may be transferred incompletely or skipped**; every piece
  of content goes to its appropriate section (creating sections where none exist). Approach: a
  **generator with a machine-checked completeness gate** (`scripts/generate_pd_seed.py`) — it consumes
  every non-empty cell through an explicit per-sheet rule and REFUSES to emit output if any cell is
  left unconsumed — plus the repo's established idempotent startup-seed pattern (same as the 33
  default lists / خودسازی seeds), so the content lands in production Postgres on the next deploy.
- **MAPPING (sheet → destination)** «چرک نویس» → 11 lists (اولویت‌ها با علت، سه کار مورد علاقه،
  کارهای زیر دو دقیقه، طرح تثبیت ×2، طرح‌های تاریخ‌دار ۲۳/۰۹–۱۷/۱۱/۲۰۲۴، بازچینش‌ها، متفرقه)؛
  « مدیریت زمان» → 4 lists (دزدان انرژی/زمان ۱۷، گزارش هفتگی ۳۷، نکات رائفی‌پور ۱۷۰، درس‌گفتار
  پناهیان جلسات ۱–۹ ۳۱۰ — حاشیه‌های ستون‌های کناری در description همان آیتم ادغام)؛ «مبارزه با هوای
  نفس» → 1 list (توضیح + ۴ آیتم با نوع/جایگزین)؛ «اهداف» → 1 list (۵ هدف، علت در description)؛
  «عادت‌ها جهت بهبود» → 2 lists (عادت‌های بد + مراحل بهبود + مقیاس دشواری؛ ۸۶ عادت روزانه با علامت
  مثبت/منفی/خنثی و راهنمای تشخیص به‌عنوان توضیح لیست)؛ «ابزارها» → 2 lists (روش انتخاب ابزار ۶ گام؛
  ۵ ابزار AI با URL و متن کامل بررسی — بدون truncate، بررسی ۳٫۶KB سالم)؛ **«حساب کتاب ماهانه» →
  بخش مالی**: حساب `FinancialAccount` آرشیوی («هزینه‌های نقدی — آرشیو اکسل»، AED) + **۱۹۴
  `Transaction`** هزینه برای ۴ ماه (سپتامبر–دسامبر ۲۰۲۴؛ تاریخ ردیف در صورت وجود، وگرنه تاریخ شروع
  ماه) + مانده بانک‌ها/وام‌ها به‌صورت لیست آرشیو (عمداً حساب زنده نساختیم تا ترازهای کهنه با وضعیت
  مالی فعلی قاطی نشود). ردیف‌های صرفاً شماره‌گذاری (ردیف ۵..۲۰ خالی) به‌عنوان ساختار مصرف شدند، نه محتوا.
- **CHANGE** `scripts/generate_pd_seed.py` (committed, re-runnable; regeneration is byte-stable) →
  generated `app/services/_personal_development_seed_data.py` (**22 lists / 820 items / 194
  transactions**, pinned counts in-module); `app/services/personal_development_seed.py`
  (`ensure_personal_development_seeded` — per-list skip-if-has-items, account-once, mirror of the
  خودسازی seeder); startup hook in `app/main.py` (isolated `@app.on_event`, best-effort). No new
  tables/columns → no migration; destinations already existed (lists UI + finance UI pick the
  content up automatically).
- **VERIFY** new `tests/test_personal_development_seed.py` 4/4 (pinned totals 22/820/194; unique
  prefixed names; no empty contents; full seed writes exactly the pinned counts; second run is a
  pure no-op; positions intact; 3.6KB review not truncated). Backend full suite **1041 passed / 13
  pre-existing failed (0 new)**; ruff clean on all new files; `npm run build` clean (no frontend change).
- **NOTE** The workbook binary itself is NOT committed (personal file; its full content now lives in
  the generated seed module). To re-import a future version: run the generator with the new path —
  the coverage gate + pinned-count tests catch any loss.

## 2026-07-10 — «نوشته‌های من»: بخش جدید نوشته‌های بلند + ورود ۴ فایل Word (خداشناسی ×۳ + برنامه‌ریزی دنیا و آخرت)

- **DECISION** Owner uploaded 4 Word files: three copies/revisions of his spiritual autobiography
  («تاریخچه خداشناسی» — شرح حال + برداشت‌های شخصی) and one worldly/hereafter goals-with-philosophy
  document. Requirements: (1) must NOT be scattered, (2) must live in its proper place, (3) the three
  overlapping files merge with **exact-duplicate-only** dedup — anything not exactly duplicated is
  preserved, (4) build the infrastructure if none exists. No existing surface fits whole multi-page
  documents (lists scatter; documents/ is identity papers) → built a new section.
- **FINDING (files)** Two of the three .doc files are **byte-identical** (md5 equal; both rev 59,
  saved 04/04/2017, 6,825 words); the third is an older revision (rev 40, saved 07/03/2017, 3,903
  words). So the real merge is v59 (base) + v40 (older). Extraction: `antiword -m UTF-8` (LibreOffice
  writer missing in the container; **catdoc output was corrupt/incomplete** — mojibake + a whole dated
  section missing — verified by normalized comparison and rejected). The .docx goals file parsed via
  zip/XML (626 paragraphs incl. table contents; footnotes/endnotes empty; metadata 2020-09-07 →
  2022-11-04).
- **CHANGE (infrastructure — new section)** `app/models/personal_writing.py` (`personal_writings`:
  title/category/body Text/source_note/written_at/sort_order, user-scoped nullable) + registration in
  `models/__init__.py` + alembic `0033_personal_writings` (create_all covers Render free tier — new
  table, no ALTERs). `app/routes/writings.py` — `/api/writings` CRUD (list omits `body` for weight;
  detail returns it whole; anon bucket sees NULL-owner rows), mounted in `main.py`. Frontend
  `frontend/src/pages/Writings.jsx` («نوشته‌های من»: فهرست دسته‌بندی‌شده + خوانندهٔ کامل، RTL،
  whitespace-pre-wrap) + route `/writings` + Sidebar entry + `ARCHITECTURE_INVENTORY.json` page row.
- **CHANGE (merge + seed)** `scripts/generate_writings_seed.py`: merged autobiography = **v59 verbatim
  + ضمیمهٔ ۶ بلوک (۷.۵هزار حرف)** from v40 whose exact text is absent from v59 (incl. the dated
  07/03/2017 addendum and «ادامه دارد…») under a clearly-marked appendix header — with a **machine
  gate: every sentence of BOTH revisions must appear verbatim (whitespace-normalised) in the merged
  body or generation fails**. Goals document stored **whole and untouched** (its فهرست‌های عشق به
  خدا/اراده/ترس‌ها/مرد الهی sections overlap the existing خودسازی lists — kept intact here as the
  integral source document; the SI lists remain the actionable copies; owner's rule permits keeping
  since only *exact* duplicates may be dropped and these are embedded in continuous prose).
  Generated `_personal_writings_seed_data.py` (2 writings; pinned bodies **53,521 + 63,310 chars**) +
  `personal_writings_seed.py` (idempotent by title — user edits survive redeploys) + startup hook.
- **VERIFY** new `tests/test_personal_writings.py` 4/4 (pinned counts/appendix-blocks/body sizes;
  content integrity incl. appendix + «مردِ خدا»; seeder idempotency + no truncation in DB; full CRUD
  roundtrip). Inventory 5/5 green. Backend full suite **1045 passed / 13 pre-existing failed (0 new)**;
  ruff clean; `npm run build` clean.
- **NOTE** Original Word binaries not committed (personal files); their full text now lives in the
  generated seed module; provenance recorded in each writing's `source_note`.

## 2026-07-14 — داشبورد «رشد ذهن و هوش»: تحلیل چندمنبعی با رفرنس + آپلود Brilliant از تلگرام/داشبورد + یادآور هفتگی

- **DECISION** Owner asked for ONE consolidated surface analysing his intelligence/logic/brain growth
  from (a) periodic Brilliant.org data-export zips and (b) his own behavioural data already in the
  app — every number carrying an explicit data reference, with a provenance check that the data is
  really HIS; upload via Telegram or the dashboard; and a weekly Telegram reminder (editable day/
  hour, mutable to silent, disableable) that re-reminds every N hours (editable) until a file is
  uploaded from EITHER channel. No such surface existed (closest: self-improvement check-ins,
  UserProfileAnalytics) → built new, consolidated under «رشد ذهن و هوش».
- **CHANGE (model)** `app/models/brain.py` — `BrainUpload` (`brain_uploads`: source/filename/via
  dashboard|telegram/verified_owner/owner_email/stats_json/analysis_note/uploaded_at) + registration
  + alembic `0034_brain_uploads` (create_all covers Render).
- **CHANGE (service)** `app/services/brain_service.py`:
  `parse_brilliant_zip` (JSON-Lines under data/production/ → interactions, practice accuracy from
  per-problem states, viewed-solution rate, lessons/courses, streaks, monthly trend — verified
  against the owner's real export: 795 interactions, 93.5% accuracy, 67/68 lessons);
  **ownership check** = export's `auth_user.email` vs known owner emails (env `OWNER_EMAIL` ∪ users
  table ∪ previously-verified uploads) → `verified_owner` flag, foreign files stored but flagged;
  `ingest_upload` (store + end reminder cycle + best-effort AI narrative with a «مراجع:» section via
  the AI catalog); `build_dashboard` — 4 sections (Brilliant trend/latest، tasks completion، خودسازی
  check-ins + tick‌خورده‌ها، finance live entries with the Excel-archive account EXCLUDED), each with
  a `provenance` block: tables, rows, calculation rule, and an `authored_by_you` rule saying exactly
  why the signal counts as the owner's own behaviour; reminder config in `global_settings`
  (`brain_reminder`: enabled/weekday/hour/silent/refollow_hours/awaiting_since/…);
  `reminder_decision` (pure, unit-tested: weekly slot → remind; awaiting + refollow_hours elapsed →
  re-remind; upload clears awaiting) + `reminder_tick` + `brain_reminder_loop` (10-min cadence,
  startup/shutdown hooks like the webhook supervisor).
- **CHANGE (routes/frontend)** `app/routes/brain.py` — GET /api/brain/dashboard، POST /upload
  (multipart zip، ۵۰MB cap)، GET /uploads، GET/PUT /reminder (validated). New
  `frontend/src/pages/BrainDashboard.jsx` («رشد ذهن و هوش»: آپلود، تنظیمات یادآور، کارت‌های بخش با
  «📌 مرجع داده» بازشونده، روند ماهانه/بین‌آپلودی، متن تحلیل AI) + route `/brain` + Sidebar +
  inventory row.
- **CHANGE (telegram upload channel)** `telegram_service._maybe_ingest_brain_zip`: any .zip document
  sent to the bot is probed with `is_brilliant_zip` — a Brilliant export is ingested directly
  (ownership line + metrics + AI note replied; reminder cycle cleared); other zips fall through to
  the compose flow unchanged.
- **Dependencies synced:** upstream — GlobalSetting, telegram bot send/download, AI `complete`,
  Task/TodoItem/SelfImprovementCheckIn/Transaction models, PD archive account name (exclusion).
  downstream — main.py router + loop hooks, telegram media routing, App/Sidebar/inventory. db — new
  table only (0034). env — optional `OWNER_EMAIL` (fallbacks exist).
- **VERIFY** new `tests/test_brain_dashboard.py` **11/11** (synthetic-zip parser pinned numbers,
  ownership verify/flag, ingest-clears-reminder, 3 reminder-decision suites incl. custom refollow,
  upload+dashboard routes with provenance assertions, junk-zip 400, reminder validation); telegram
  40/40 unchanged; backend full suite **1056 passed / 13 pre-existing failed (0 new)**; ruff clean;
  `npm run build` clean. Parser sanity-checked against the real export locally (not committed —
  personal data).
- **LIMITATION** Reminder hour is UTC (stated in the UI). AI narrative requires a configured text
  model (fail-open). The reminder loop is in-process/single-replica (like the webhook supervisor).
